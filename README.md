# About Me
**Name:** 
Karen Roman
**Hometown:** 
Kingston, Jamaica
**Prior IT Experience:**
One of the most compelling reasons I chose cybersecurity is its resilience to economic downturns and global disruptions. Unlike traditional industries, which suffered massive layoffs during the pandemic, cybersecurity professionals remained in high demand.
**Career Plans:** 
Cybersecurity professionals are the digital front-line defense against hackers, identity thieves, and malicious cyber activities. With technology integrated into every aspect of daily life, individuals, corporations, and even government entities are at risk of cyberattacks. By pursuing this career, I will contribute to safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of digital infrastructure. This responsibility aligns with my desire to engage in meaningful work that helps others while providing me with a stable and fulfilling career.
**Proud Project/Task:**
Setting up my GitHub account and adding my first repository is a proud milestone for me! It marks my first step into version control, a crucial skill in software development, and the beginning of building my public portfolio. With this, I’m embracing best practices like committing to changes, collaborating, and joining a global community of developers. No matter how simple, this repository represents something I created and shared, paving the way for future growth, open-source contributions, and career opportunities. I'm excited about what’s ahead!
